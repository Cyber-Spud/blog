            <h2>The Alchemist</h2>
            <p>
              And although it’s appearance was only brief, the impression it left lingered on long after its absence from the laboratory. 
              <br><br>
No amount of scouring trough tomes of literature would prepare him for the grand cataclysm that occurred after witnessing such a fortunate happenstance of nature for the very first time.
<br><br>
Once a passioned quest for novelty, the experience had ultimately shaken off the shackles of uncertainty and doubt around such matters. Now, it forever rendered the seeking of such phenomena an attempt of replication, burgeoning in its fruitlessness.
<br><br>
All the knowledge in the world was unable to serve him henceforth. Except inasmuch as it reminded him of the alleged rarity and uniqueness of the brief ordeal. Begging into question the continuation of this labored search. 
<br><br>
He could only think back to those precious few moments when, upon complete accident, a multitudinous array of colours playfully emanated from his crucible. With stolen breath, and his monochromatic instruments of inquiry rendered useless. Softly brushing him on the cheek as a parting gift of grace before being wisped into memory, being consumed back into the empty air which it appeared to emerge from.
<br><br>
It would only be in hindsight that he realized that the cannon of his life had been fervently divided by that fateful day he was bestowed with the experience of the meaning of true colour. The markings still left on his laboratory apparatus a persistent reminder of how unprepared he was for the ordeal.
<br><br>
Life would henceforth be characterized by its absence. Soldered into his narrative, he would grow accustomed to its brazen protrusion that would undeniably draw the eyes away from the uniformity of the planar surface. This was by no means a crude application either. Far from it. The elegance in which it emerged and placed itself suggested that this was not a an act of probability, but rather, a force of will.
<br><br>
The passing of years hardened the edges of this milestone. It’s significance deepened as he saw many others embarking on this same path of discovery as he once did. Some gave up with bitter resentment, claiming it could not be found. Others produced washed out imitations, and foolishly concluded they had succeeded. 
<br><br>
He was eventually forced to concede that any person impetuous enough to claim that they knew exactly what they were searching for was someone that was not truly looking, had never been completely consumed by the grace of discovering something other, and whom had not truly lived.
<br><br>
He can be seen from time to time wearing a vacant expression. Perhaps by the stirring of a passing comment, or a instance of clarity arising within the midst of his tireless workday. And resting in a few brief moments of bewilderment, he would once again allow himself to forget everything he had ever learned. 
<br><br>
Quietly. Conceding. 
<br><br>
“...Wow...”
